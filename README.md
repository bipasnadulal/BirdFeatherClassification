 # ðŸª¶ Bird Feather Color Classification System
A Deep Learning-based image classification project to detect bird feather colors using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Built with TensorFlow, Keras, and Gradio, this system classifies feathers into 12 color categories with high accuracy.
---
### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to identify the color of bird feathers from images using deep learning. The system is trained on a dataset of ~2400 feather images across the following 12 classes:
- Black
- Blue
- Brown
- Gray
- Green
- Orange
- Purple
- Red
- White
- Yellow
- Iridescent
- Multicolor

Users can upload an image via a simple Gradio interface and receive a prediction in real-time.
